- Done +get wordpress in repo+

* VM setup wordpress
1. make sure vm can ping and accept outside networks
   - ~ping google.com~
2. be in your home directory
   - ~cd~
3. git clone the repo from github into your user public facing folder
   - ~git clone https://github.com/Gameboyz/website.git public_html~
4. check that you can either ssh into the vm or use a file transfer program (winscp, filezilla, etc.)
5. download these files from google drive: .htaccess, fix-db-urls.php and wp-config.php
6. open the .htaccess file in a text editor and replace all instances of jared with your username
7. copy the files from google drive to the vm
   - ~.htaccess -> ~/public_html/~
   - ~wp-config.php -> ~/public_html/~
   - ~fix-db-urls.php -> ~/~
8. open up phpmyadmin in your web browser on your host machine (the vm doesnt have a web browser), login as root (this info you have to request)
   1. ~ifconfig~ and find the ip address your machine is using
   2. ~<ip_of_machine>/phpmyadmin~
9. in phpmyadmin 
   1. go to the databases tab
   2. checkmark the ~wp_gameboyz~ database
   3. then click the ~Drop~ link just below on the same page
   4. in the google drive capstone folder, download the ~localhost.sql~ file
   5. back in phpmyadmin, click on the import tab
   6. click on the browse button under File to Import and select the ~localhost.sql~ file (from where ever its stored)
   7. click go
10. go to the command line of the vm, make sure you're in the public_html directory
    - ~cd ~/public_html~
11. run the fix-db-urls.php script
    - ~./fix-db-urls.php~
12. open up your web browser and check to see if the website loads
    - ~<ip_of_machine>/~<username>~
13. check login for wp-admin
    - ~<ip_of_machine>/~<username>/wp-admin~
14. if working, good, you're done

* The Theme submodule
The theme is a separate git repo -> [[https://github.com/Gameboyz/theme][theme]], it's included in this repo, but to keep it updated, it's not really obvious.
** Getting the newest commit
1. go to the command line, and be in the root of the website folder
   - ~cd ~/public_html/~
2. init the submodule (a git repo inside a git repo) of the theme
   - ~git submodule init~
3. update the submodule
   - ~git submodule update~
4. *note* The submodule will only update if the the main repo has the newest linked version from the theme repo
5. Finished, you should have the newest version from the git repo

** Updating the theme repo
This is like editing any other git repo, but with a couple of added steps for the main repo.

this should only be in the templates branch

*IMPORTANT:* Whenever updating the theme repo for the website repo, make sure it will be the only commit you will be making.


1. go to the theme repo
   - ~cd ~/public_html/wp-content/themes/mommod/~
2. do your regualr commit (add the moded files, double check your working on the correct branch, commit with a proper message, so on)
3. now go back to the root of the website repo
   - ~cd ~/public_html~
4. do a git add on the theme directory
   - ~git add wp-content/themes/mommod/~
5. commit the changes
6. push to the correct branch
7. Finish, hopefully all is well
